## Project Summary

This is a summary of the project!
Content creators are constantly looking to identify ways to increase engagement and expand their audiences. By using a dataset that stores several months of daily trending videos on YouTube, we are hoping to identify patterns and trends that exist within the trending videos on YouTube. By the end of this project, we will ideally have a website which will guide content creators in general with their decisions regarding how they are publishing and marketing the content that they produce. Creators may find recommendations for when the ideal times are to publish a video or formatting techniques to improve engagement by using the aforementioned functions described. Our goal by the end of the semester is to have a system that seamlessly recommends content creators the optimal choices when producing content.
